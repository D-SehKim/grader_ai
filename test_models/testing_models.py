Trump had urged House Republicans to reject a reauthorization of the law, known as FISA, ahead of the key procedural vote on Wednesday, adding to headaches for GOP leaders who have struggled to build support for the legislation, but were still attempting to forge ahead and advance the bill.  “KILL FISA,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social.  This marks the fourth time in Johnsons tenure that the House has defeated a rule vote, a major embarrassment for leadership. The tally was 193 to 228, with 19 Republicans bucking House GOP leadership and voting with Democrats to sink the procedural vote and take down a rule to govern debate on the reauthorization bill as well as several other bills.  House Republicans have been fiercely divided over how to handle the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act reauthorization, putting pressure on Johnson to find a path forward amid competing factions within his conference. With the threat of a vote on his ouster looming, the Louisiana Republican’s every move is under even more intense scrutiny, and the speaker has once again found himself odds with his right flank over the surveillance law.  Johnson signaled he still believes they can find a path forward on FISA this week despite deep divisions and little progress after two lengthy conference meetings devoted to the topic Wednesday.  “We still have time on the clock this week,” he told reporters. “We are going to try and find a way to unlock the rule and I think its possible.”  “We will be talking to members about it tonight, trying to figure that out,” he added.  What does this mean for the United States as a whole?')
